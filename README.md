## Introduction
This guide covers programming languages that every student should know about.
Each section is written by a different team member.

## Html/css

### What HTML Stands For
**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.  
It is the standard language used to structure content on the web.

### What HTML Is Used For
HTML is used to define the **structure and content** of a web page. With HTML, you can:
- Create headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Add links, images, tables, and forms
- Organize content using elements like headers, sections, and footers

HTML focuses on *what* content appears on a page, not how it looks.

### What CSS Stands For
**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**.  
It is the language used to style and design web pages.

### What CSS Is Used For
CSS controls the **visual appearance** of a website. It is used to:
- Set colors, fonts, and backgrounds
- Control spacing, alignment, and layout
- Make websites responsive for different screen sizes

CSS focuses on *how* the content looks.

### Where HTML and CSS Fit in Web Development
HTML and CSS form the **foundation of front-end web development**.

In a typical web stack:
- **HTML** provides the structure
- **CSS** handles the presentation and design
- **JavaScript** adds interactivity and behavior

Together, HTML and CSS allow developers to create well-structured, visually appealing web pages that users can view in any browser.


## JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used to build interactive and dynamic web applications.
It runs in the browser and on servers using environments like Node.js.

### Why JavaScript Is Important
- It is the core language of the web.
- It works on both frontend and backend.
- It has a large ecosystem and community.
- It is widely used in modern frameworks and tools.

### Common Uses
- Building interactive websites
- Frontend frameworks like React and Vue
- Backend development with Node.js
- Desktop and mobile applications

### Learning Resources
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)

```JavaScript
// Simple JavaScript example
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("Student"));
```
## Python

**Python** is a high-level popular programming language that's easy to read and write, much like plain *English*. First released in 1991 by `Guido van Rossum`, it powers everything from websites to data analysis and games.

### Why Students Should Use It
- It works on any OS and integrates well with other languages.
- It uses simple indentation instead of brackets to organize code making it easy to read and reduce on errors.
- Its huge library of ready-made tools makes it ideal for web development,data analysis,AI,machine learning and more.
- Python teaches step-by-step problem-solving and breaks down complex tasks.

### Python for professionals
- Rapid productivity gains using fewer lines of code.
- Cross industry dominance.
- Future proof investment.

### How to Get Started
1. Download it from [download.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads//).
2. Run it, check "Add python.exe to PATH" at the bottom, then click "Install Now" *use admin rights if needed*.
3. Open Command Prompt, type `python --version` to verify - it should show the version number.

## Indentation in python
```python
## Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Consistent use of spaces (commonly 4) or a tab is required.
