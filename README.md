## JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used to build interactive and dynamic web applications.
It runs in the browser and on servers using environments like Node.js.

### Why JavaScript Is Important
- It is the core language of the web.
- It works on both frontend and backend.
- It has a large ecosystem and community.
- It is widely used in modern frameworks and tools.

### Common Uses
- Building interactive websites
- Frontend frameworks like React and Vue
- Backend development with Node.js
- Desktop and mobile applications

## Python

**Python** is a high-level popular programming language that's easy to read and write, much like plain *English*. First released in 1991 by `Guido van Rossum`, it powers everything from websites to data analysis and games.

### Why Students Should Use It
- It works on any OS and integrates well with other languages.
- It uses simple indentation instead of brackets to organize code making it easy to read and reduce on errors.
- Its huge library of ready-made tools makes it ideal for web development,data analysis,AI,machine learning and more.
- Python teaches step-by-step problem-solving and breaks down complex tasks.

### How to Get Started
1. Download it from [download.python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads//).
2. Run it, check "Add python.exe to PATH" at the bottom, then click "Install Now" *use admin rights if needed*.
3. Open Command Prompt, type `python --version` to verify - it should show the version number.
