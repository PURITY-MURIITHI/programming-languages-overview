- It uses simple indentation instead of brackets to organize code making it easy to read and reduce on errors.
- Its huge library of ready-made tools makes it ideal for web development,data analysis,AI,machine learning and more.
- Python teaches step-by-step problem-solving and breaks down complex tasks.
